# Java Tutorial

## What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose, versatile, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language created by James Gosling and team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-90s. It has since become one of software development's most widely used and influential programming languages.

### Brief history of Java
Java, developed by James Gosling and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in the mid-'90s, was originally designed for interactive television. However, it found its true calling as a versatile, platform-independent programming language.
Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy allows developers to write code on one platform and run it on any other, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.

### Why learn Java?
Java's widespread use in web development, mobile applications (Android), enterprise systems, and big data makes it a valuable language to learn. It's known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive community support.
Whether you're a budding software engineer or looking to broaden your programming skills, Java provides a solid foundation for understanding key programming concepts.

### Setting up Java Development Environment
You'll need to set up a development environment to start your Java journey. Follow these steps:

1.	Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK. Ensure your system's PATH variable includes the JDK's "bin" directory.
2.	Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Pick one that suits your preferences.
3.	Write Your First Java Program: Open your IDE, create a new project, and write a simple "Hello World" program. This ensures your setup is working seamlessly.
